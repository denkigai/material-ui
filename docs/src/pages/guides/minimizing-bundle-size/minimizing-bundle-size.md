# Minimizing bundle size

<p class="description">Learn more about the tools you can leverage to reduce the bundle size.</p>

## Bundle size matters

The bundle size of Material-UI is taken very seriously. Size snapshots are taken
on every commit for every package and critical parts of those packages ([view the latest snapshot](/size-snapshot)).
Combined with [dangerJS](https://danger.systems/js/) we can inspect
[detailed bundle size changes](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/pull/14638#issuecomment-466658459) on every Pull Request.

## When and how to use tree-shaking?

Tree-shaking of Material-UI works out of the box in modern frameworks.
Material-UI exposes its full API on the top-level `material-ui` import.
If you're using ES6 modules and a bundler that supports tree-shaking ([`webpack` >= 2.x](https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking/), [`parcel` with a flag](https://en.parceljs.org/cli.html#enable-experimental-scope-hoisting/tree-shaking-support)) you can safely use named imports and still get an optimized bundle size automatically:

```js
import { Button, TextField } from '@material-ui/core';
```

⚠️ The following instructions are only needed if you want to optimize your development startup times or if you are using an older bundler
that doesn't support tree-shaking.

## Development environment

Development bundles can contain the full library which can lead to **slower startup times**.
This is especially noticeable if you import from `@material-ui/icons`.
Startup times can be approximately 6x slower than without named imports from the top-level API.

If this is an issue for you, you have various options:

### Option 1

You can use path imports to avoid pulling in unused modules.
For instance, use:

```js
// 🚀 Fast
import Button from '@material-ui/core/Button';
import TextField from '@material-ui/core/TextField';
```

instead of top-level imports (without a Babel plugin):

```js
import { Button, TextField } from '@material-ui/core';
```

This is the option we document in all the demos since it requires no configuration.
It is encouraged for library authors that are extending the components.
Head to [Option 2](#option-2) for the approach that yields the best DX and UX.

While importing directly in this manner doesn't use the exports in [the main file of `@material-ui/core`](https://unpkg.com/@material-ui/core), this file can serve as a handy reference as to which modules are public.

Be aware that we only support first and second-level imports.
Anything deeper is considered private and can cause issues, such as module duplication in your bundle.

```js
// ✅ OK
import { Add as AddIcon } from '@material-ui/icons';
import { Tabs } from '@material-ui/core';
//                                 ^^^^ 1st or top-level

// ✅ OK
import AddIcon from '@material-ui/icons/Add';
import Tabs from '@material-ui/core/Tabs';
//                                  ^^^^ 2nd level

// ❌ NOT OK
import TabIndicator from '@material-ui/core/Tabs/TabIndicator';
//                                               ^^^^^^^^^^^^ 3rd level
```

If you're using `eslint` you can catch problematic imports with the [`no-restricted-imports` rule](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-restricted-imports). The following `.eslintrc` configuration will highlight problematic imports from `@material-ui` packages:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "no-restricted-imports": [
      "error",
      {
        "patterns": ["@material-ui/*/*/*", "!@material-ui/core/test-utils/*"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Option 2

This option provides the best User Experience and Developer Experience:

- UX: The Babel plugin enables top-level tree-shaking even if your bundler doesn't support it.
- DX: The Babel plugin makes startup time in dev mode as fast as Option 1.
- DX: This syntax reduces the duplication of code, requiring only a single import for multiple modules.
  Overall, the code is easier to read, and you are less likely to make a mistake when importing a new module.

```js
import { Button, TextField } from '@material-ui/core';
```

However, you need to apply the two following steps correctly.

#### 1. Configure Babel

Pick one of the following plugins:

- [babel-plugin-import](https://github.com/ant-design/babel-plugin-import) with the following configuration:

  `yarn add -D babel-plugin-import`

  Create a `.babelrc.js` file in the root directory of your project:

  ```js
  const plugins = [
    [
      'babel-plugin-import',
      {
        libraryName: '@material-ui/core',
        libraryDirectory: '',
        camel2DashComponentName: false,
      },
      'core',
    ],
    [
      'babel-plugin-import',
      {
        libraryName: '@material-ui/icons',
        libraryDirectory: '',
        camel2DashComponentName: false,
      },
      'icons',
    ],
  ];

  module.exports = { plugins };
  ```

- [babel-plugin-direct-import](https://github.com/umidbekk/babel-plugin-direct-import) with the following configuration:

  `yarn add -D babel-plugin-direct-import`

  Create a `.babelrc.js` file in the root directory of your project:

  ```js
  const plugins = [
    [
      'babel-plugin-direct-import',
      { modules: ['@material-ui/core', '@material-ui/icons'] },
    ],
  ];

  module.exports = { plugins };
  ```

If you are using Create React App, you will need to use a couple of projects that let you use `.babelrc` configuration, without ejecting.

`yarn add -D react-app-rewired customize-cra`

Create a `config-overrides.js` file in the root directory:

```js
/* config-overrides.js */
/* eslint-disable react-hooks/rules-of-hooks */
const { useBabelRc, override } = require('customize-cra');

module.exports = override(useBabelRc());
```

If you wish, `babel-plugin-import` can be configured through `config-overrides.js` instead of `.babelrc` by using this [configuration](https://github.com/arackaf/customize-cra/blob/master/api.md#fixbabelimportslibraryname-options).

Modify your `package.json` commands:

```diff
  "scripts": {
-   "start": "react-scripts start",
+   "start": "react-app-rewired start",
-   "build": "react-scripts build",
+   "build": "react-app-rewired build",
-   "test": "react-scripts test",
+   "test": "react-app-rewired test",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"
}
```

Enjoy significantly faster start times.

#### 2. Convert all your imports

Finally, you can convert your existing codebase to this option with this [top-level-imports codemod](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@material-ui/codemod#top-level-imports).
It will perform the following diffs:

```diff
-import Button from '@material-ui/core/Button';
-import TextField from '@material-ui/core/TextField';
+import { Button, TextField } from '@material-ui/core';
```

## Available bundles

The package published on npm is **transpiled**, with [Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel), to take into account the [supported platforms](/getting-started/supported-platforms/).

⚠️ In order to minimize duplication of code in users' bundles, library authors are **strongly discouraged** to import from any of the other bundles.

### Modern bundle

The modern bundle can be found under the [`/modern` folder](https://unpkg.com/@material-ui/core/modern/).
It targets the latest released versions of evergreen browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
This can be used to make separate bundles targeting different browsers.

### Legacy bundle

If you need to support IE 11 you cannot use the default or modern bundle without transpilation.
However, you can use the legacy bundle found under the [`/legacy` folder](https://unpkg.com/@material-ui/core/legacy/).
You don't need any additional polyfills.
